description: Before he gained notoriety as the lawyer who defended teenage murderers
  Leopold and Loeb, lawyer Clarence Darrow was an important figure in the labor movement
  and progressive causes. In his talk Industrial Conspiracies, Darrow provides a wide-ranging
  look at his own political philosophy, including his somewhat radical insistence
  that the U.S. Constitution -- and by extension, the country's system of democracy
  -- should be abolished and rebuilt from scratch.
